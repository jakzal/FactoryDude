Factory Dude
============

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jakzal/FactoryDude.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/jakzal/FactoryDude)

Aim of Factory Dude is to make [Test Data Builder Pattern](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TestDataBuilder) easier to implement with as
little effort and duplicate code as possible.

**Note**: This is an experiment I'm doing to learn PHPSpec2. Project might
change its concepts, aim or be completely abandoned.
